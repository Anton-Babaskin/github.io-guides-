# Critical Postfix Mistakes That Kill Your Domain Reputation

After 13+ years of managing enterprise email systems, I've seen how poor Postfix configuration turns corporate email into a nightmare. Emails land in spam, domains get blacklisted, businesses lose customers.

Here are the 5 most critical mistakes I encounter regularly:

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Missing Proper PTR Record (Reverse DNS)

**The Problem:** 90% of administrators forget to configure reverse DNS for their mail server.

**Why it's critical:**
‚Ä¢ Gmail and Outlook automatically spam emails without proper PTR records
‚Ä¢ Many corporate filters block emails without PTR entirely

**The solution:**
```bash
# Check your current PTR record
dig -x YOUR_SERVER_IP

# Should return your mail domain
# mail.company.com.
```

**Pro tip:** PTR record must exactly match the HELO/EHLO name in Postfix. No "server1.hosting.com" shortcuts - only your real mail domain.

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Broken SPF/DKIM/DMARC Setup

**Most common mistake:** "I configured SPF, that's enough."

**Wrong!** In 2025, this is a trinity of required records:

**SPF (too restrictive):**
```
‚ùå v=spf1 ip4:YOUR_IP -all
‚úÖ v=spf1 ip4:YOUR_IP include:_spf.google.com ~all
```

**DKIM (forgetting key rotation):**
```bash
# Generate new key every 6 months
opendkim-genkey -t -s mail -d yourdomain.com
```

**DMARC (starting with p=reject):**
```
‚ùå Immediate p=reject - blocks legitimate emails
‚úÖ Start with p=none, analyze reports for a month, then p=quarantine
```

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Ignoring Postscreen

**Typical situation:** "We have SpamAssassin, why need more?"

**Reality:** Postscreen blocks 80% of spam BEFORE SpamAssassin processing, saving massive server resources.

**Critical settings:**
```bash
# main.cf
postscreen_access_list = permit_mynetworks,
    cidr:/etc/postfix/postscreen_access.cidr
postscreen_dnsbl_sites = zen.spamhaus.org*3,
    bl.spamcop.net*2, b.barracudacentral.org*2
postscreen_dnsbl_threshold = 2
postscreen_greet_action = enforce
```

**Result:** Server load drops 5-10x. Your infrastructure team will thank you.

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Wrong Greylisting Configuration

**Rookie mistake:** Installing Postgrey with default settings.

**The problem:** 5+ minute delays kill user experience for important emails.

**My approach:**
```bash
# Reduce delay time
postgrey_delay = 60  # instead of 300 seconds

# Add whitelist for major providers
# /etc/postgrey/whitelist_clients.local
gmail.com
outlook.com  
mailchimp.com
```

**Advanced technique:** Configure dynamic whitelist based on sender reputation score.

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Zero Queue and Reputation Monitoring

**Critical mistake:** "Email works, nothing to monitor."

**Reality:** Reputation issues develop gradually and silently.

**What I monitor religiously:**
‚Ä¢ Queue size: `mailq | tail -1`
‚Ä¢ Bounce rate: keep under 5%
‚Ä¢ Blacklist status: check via MXToolbox API
‚Ä¢ DMARC reports: analyze weekly

## 6Ô∏è‚É£ Weak TLS Configuration

**Dangerous oversight:** Using default TLS settings from 2015.

**The problem:** Modern email providers reject weak encryption. Gmail, Office365 require TLS 1.2+ with strong ciphers.

**My TLS hardening:**
```bash
# main.cf - enforce strong TLS
smtpd_tls_security_level = may
smtpd_tls_protocols = !SSLv2, !SSLv3, !TLSv1, !TLSv1.1
smtpd_tls_ciphers = high
smtpd_tls_exclude_ciphers = aNULL, eNULL, EXPORT, DES, RC4, MD5, PSK, SRP, CAMELLIA, SEED
```

**Result:** Eliminates "TLS negotiation failed" bounces that kill deliverability.

## 7Ô∏è‚É£ Missing Rate Limiting

**Critical mistake:** No protection against compromised accounts or scripts.

**What happens:** One compromised account sends 10K emails/hour ‚Üí instant IP blacklist ‚Üí ALL company email blocked.

**My protection layers:**
```bash
# main.cf - rate limiting
smtpd_client_connection_count_limit = 10
smtpd_client_message_rate_limit = 100
smtpd_client_recipient_rate_limit = 200
```

**Real case:** Saved a client from 3-day Spamhaus blacklist when their WordPress got hacked.

## üí° BONUS: Quick Problem Diagnosis

When clients complain "emails aren't delivering," I check in this order:

1. **Postfix logs:** `tail -f /var/log/mail.log`
2. **DNS records:** `dig MX domain.com` + `dig TXT domain.com`
3. **Blacklist status:** Check IP in major RBLs
4. **Email test:** Send to mail-tester.com
5. **DMARC reports:** Look for failure patterns

**Result:** I diagnose 90% of problems within 10 minutes.

## üéØ Bottom Line

Corporate email setup isn't "set and forget." It requires constant monitoring, analysis, and optimization.

**My checklist for every new mail server:**
‚úÖ PTR record configured  
‚úÖ SPF/DKIM/DMARC working  
‚úÖ Postscreen active  
‚úÖ Greylisting configured smartly  
‚úÖ All metrics monitored  

Following these rules guarantees 99%+ deliverability and peaceful nights for your entire team.
